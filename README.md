Unlike our physical features, a culture is not something that is transmitted automatically by the mere accident of birth it must be nurtured, appreciated and passed onto the next generation. Of all cultural products, mythology is perhaps the most powerful, not only because it has the capacity to enthrall us with its imaginative prowess, but also because playfully conveys ideas about the good, the bad and most importantly, the grey. As a civilization that is thousands of years old, India has a rich tapestry of mythological traditions, each of them distinct, yet tightly interwoven within our civilizational fabric.

However, sadly, while we had grandmothers who would regale us with mythological tales, our children have been deprived of these simple pleasures. Instead, an overload of gadgets and television have clogged both our minds and theirs.

Hence, we thought, why not bring these tales to our kids in a manner most appealing to them - through their phones and tablets. With this in mind, we present to you our app - MythicalGods, which brings to you popular Indian myths in the form of interactive quizzes and flash cards. Catered to both children and their parents, this app is a fun, light way to learn (as well as refresh our knowledge) about Indian mythologies. Care has been taken not to overburden the user with too many details, and to make the experience both entertaining as well as mentally rewarding.

We are aware that in a country like India, religious myths also differ by region and community. Thus, we have started with the most popular mythologies that will appeal to a wide audience.
